# Survival Spectator
Spectate in your game, while in survival.  
Type `/s` in-game to switch between survival and spectator.

## What is this?
Have you watched Hermitcraft before? Hermits often log in with a second account to spectate.  
`But I do not have a second account!` is probably what you have said before.

This mod is the solution to server owners or singleplayer. With this mod installed, you can easily switch between survival and spectator mode. When you go into spectator mode, a fake player will spawn at where you were (1.0.2+). If the fake player is hurt, you will also get hurt and return to where you were.
